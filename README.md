# Withernauts: A Zoology of the world of Withernauts
A monster-only, 1.12.2 version of the upcoming overhaul, Withernauts.

## Development Environment
1. Click Gradle > forgegradle > setupDecompWorkspace
2. Click build runClient

## Known Issues
This version of Withernauts is NO LONGER SUPPORTED. Add this to your modpacks at your own peril.

Additionally, I strongly advise against using this code as reference for your own projects, it is poorly structured and designed.

Everything there was rebuilt from the ground up with better portability and design principles in mind for the main version of Withernauts.
 This however, was an exercise in learning Forge from a while ago.

### Incompatible IDEA Runtime
Error: `The project uses Gradle 2.14 which is incompatible with IDEA running on Java 10 or newer.`

Solution:
1. Install the [Choose Runtime Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12836-choose-runtime)
2. **Find Action** (Ctrl+Shift+A) -> Choose Runtime
3. Select Java 1.8
